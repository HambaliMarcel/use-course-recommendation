Simulate green fuel leakage and dispersion with CFD;Safety is the biggest challenge in developing new green electrofuels. We do not know exactly what emissions may be released by the e-fuels like hydrogen, methanol or ammonia. As a result, we are unaware of their potential impacts on humans and the environment.;FORCE
Digital twin prototype;Step 1 – Defining the system and initial dimensioning Identifying the operational constrictions, bottlenecks and weak points early in the design phase is vital. In this step you can test the response of the product during different scenarios with real time response of parameter changes. Flanked by a 3D CAD model for visualising the spatial geometry and initial dimensioning, the main characteristics of the product can be defined. Step 2 – Virtual testing and optimisation Critical components or processes of the product are simulated using multi physical 3D models of the product, based on the parameters and CAD from step 1. Such high-fidelity simulations are taking all relevant details into account. Based on the findings, topology, process and performance can be optimised. Step 3 – Calibrating the dynamic system model Using the optimised product from step 2, a Reduced Order Modelling technique can be used on the high-fidelity simulations and implemented in the dynamic system model from step 1, providing a highly accurate but fast dynamic system model. Having this platform reduces the amount of expensive physical prototypes as the risk of issues arising doing the physical test programs is reduced significantly. Step 4 – Virtual commissioning The calibrated system model can also be used in the planning of the physical prototype test program and even testing and debugging the PLC on simulated conditions and perform software- (SiL) or hardware-in-the-loop testing, reducing valuable commissioning time.;FORCE
Assured capacity of thermal energy storage using CFD;From waste to source Storing surplus heat from industrial processes is a challenge that when attained, creates economic benefits both for industrial process plants and combined heat and power plants. Moreover, the environmental benefits for society due to reduced over-production and thus minimized waste is substantial. This is where thermal energy storage, also known as heat storage tanks, make a difference.;FORCE
Design and validation of efficient ventilation systems using CFD;Promotion of safe conditions  Proper heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems play an important role in the creation of safe conditions, both within industrial and residential spaces.  These systems are necessary to provide individuals with air conditions that are humanly comfortable to withstand. Also, they are required to comply with safety regulations that consider detailed factors, dependent on the purpose of each building or single room.;FORCE
Digital twins;A digital twin can add extra value to your organisation, production line or product. This is true on several levels – from the design phase and production through operation to the end of the life cycle.  For example, the digital twin can sharpen your competitive advantage for a product by increasing its performance and predicting its expected lifetime. This can ensure energy savings and better utilisation of resources.  Digital development & optimisation  During the design phase of aproduct, adigital twinallows representing the ideal version of the coming product using 3D models and simulations.  The digital representation of what was previously just an idea provides knowledge of product performance and the opportunity to test new ideas and improvements, before embarking on costly manufacturing and physical testing.  The simulation-driven design results in a significant cost reduction compared to traditional product design iterations. It also provides the opportunity to identify and test potential initiatives for energy and resource savings in a digital environment before final implementation and operation.;FORCE
Combustion simulations;The performance of a wide range of processes and engineering technology are closely coupled to the flow conditions in the plant. Designing good flow solutions requires detailed knowledge about the actual flow conditions, which we can establish.We offer a unique combination of physical experiments and numerical investigations based on a theoretical foundation and our extensive experience. This gives you optimal knowledge about the flow conditions in your plant or product, and allows you to make the correct decision about where to change the design to obtain the optimal solution regarding performance, energy efficiency and environmental load.Our services span from consultancy at the design stage through diagnostics and evaluation to optimisation of flow solutions. Flow optimisation is always performed in a close collaboration with the customer as we need to integrate detailed specifics about your product as well as to consider other conditions besides the flow technical issues, such as production or application of the product. This is important to ensure a successful solution.;FORCE
